# 7-point criteria evaluation Database (D7P)
The 7-point criteria evaluation Database (D7P) [3] is a dermatology dataset for the prediction of the 7-point skin lesion malignancy checklist. The dataset includes over 2000 2D images. More information about the data, along with instructions on how to download the data can be found [here](https://derm.cs.sfu.ca/Welcome.html). Once downloaded, follow these steps:
- a) Ensure the downloaded directory `release_v0` is in the directory `data/D7P`.
- b) Go to the directory `data/D7P`, and run the python3 file `process_D7P.py`. This will create csv files train, test and valid which are compatable with the repository's code. These will not include images with class Miscellaneous or Letingo.
The data should now be compatable with the code. A big thanks to [Zeju Li](https://github.com/ZerojumpLine/Robust-Skin-Lesion-Classification/tree/main) for helping create this code. If there are any issues, please feel free to reach out!
